# 🕶️ AR Tracking System with Distance Calculation for Hololens

This project demonstrates a 3D tracking system with real-time distance calculation, using AR technologies. The application calculates the distance between the user's position and a specific point in space, displays it on a label, and provides warnings if the user approaches a danger zone.

# ✨ Features

1. 🕵️ Real-time tracking: Track the position and orientation of the user in 3D space.
2. 📏 Distance Calculation: Calculate the distance between the user's position and the origin of the World Coordinate System (CSYS).
3. ⚠️ Warning System: Display a warning popup if the user gets too close to the danger zone.
4. 🏷️ Label Display: Show the calculated distance on a 3D label.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

1. 🌐 AngularJS/Ionic: For handling the front-end and event-based UI updates.
2. 💻 JavaScript: For implementing tracking, vector calculations, and distance warnings.
