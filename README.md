# AR-Tracking-System-with-Distance-Calculation
This project demonstrates a 3D tracking system with real-time distance calculation, using AR technologies. The application calculates the distance between the user's position and a specific point in space, displays it on a label, and provides warnings if the user approaches a danger zone.
